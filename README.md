In this project, I worked with a Data Base about some of the weapons that where available during the season 14, also called Season of the splicer. The data base was built with about 407 different weapons, to that data base I added more information, that where the rating that players gave those weapons for PvE and PvP, also adding the rarity of those weapons (How many players owned those weapons).

After completing the ETL and the data base, I loaded the information in some Excel documents to Microsoft PowerBI and there i created some dashboards and I saw some very interesting information. Like

    - 79 weapons (19.36%) rarity was Exotic.

    - The world(Open world) has the highest amount of drops as weapons source.
